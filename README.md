# Versioned-PROV

Versioned-PROV is a PROV extension that adds support for the provenance of mutable values by time-versioning entities. This extension is useful to represent fine-grained provenance from scripts with multiple variables refering to the same data structures and nested data-structures.

## Development

We use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/dew-uff/versioned-prov/tree/master/notebooks) with [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) to generate image files.

For parsing PROV-N files and generating customized `.dot` files with support to the extensions, we use [extensible_provn](https://github.com/JoaoFelipe/extensible_provn).

We also use pypandoc to convert markdown files from the [source directory](https://github.com/dew-uff/versioned-prov/raw/master/source) into html.

Thus, for running the files, please install Python 3.6 and Graphviz, and run:
```
pip install jupyter extensible_provn pandas numpy matplotlib pypandoc
```
or in the root of this repository:
```
pip install -e .
```


For updating the project markdowns, please edit the files in the [source directory](https://github.com/dew-uff/versioned-prov/raw/master/source) and run:
```
python build.py
```


### Past Development

During the development of Versioned-PROV, we developed two other extensions with the same goal: Mutable-PROV and Intertwined-PROV.

*[Mutable-PROV](https://dew-uff.github.io/versioned-prov/mutable-prov.html)* uses PROV-Dictionary for solving P1 and versioning for solving P2. However, (P3) it adds bidirectional or return edges and (P4) created versions for all entities (including immutable elements).

*[Intertwined-PROV](https://dew-uff.github.io/versioned-prov/intertwined-prov.html)*, besides solving P1 and P2, also solves P3 by using interwined versioning (See Figure 7 of https://doi.org/10.1145/280277.280280). However, it still suffers from P4. All in all, it improves the management of complex entities (collections), but has some drawbacks on simple entities (literals and immutable variables).

*Versioned-PROV* does not suffer from any of these problems.

By comparing the number of statements in these approaches:

The Mutable-PROV approach has less relationships than Versioned-PROV. This occurs because Mutable-PROV does not have an `entity` for every part of a `value`, and does not use `wasDerivedFrom` relationships in accesses, due to the lach of these `entities`. On the other hand, Mutable-PROV has a much bigger number of nodes, due to the addition of `values`.

The Intertwined-PROV approach is very similar to the Versioned-PROV, but the former use explict `Version` entities with `specializationOf` relationships from the entities, while the latter has the version concept implicitly built into the entities, through the checkpoints in `hadMember` relationships. Hence, the Intertwined-PROV approach produces much more nodes and relationships than Versioned-PROV.


Querying with Mutable-PROV and Intertwined-PROV is as hard as querying with Versioned-PROV, but they are more powerful than Plain PROV and PROV-Dictionary.
